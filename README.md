# Car Price Predictor: Predicting Second-Hand Car Prices

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict the prices of second-hand cars based on various features. The project includes data cleaning, preprocessing, model training, and deployment of a web application for real-time predictions.

## Data Description

The dataset contains 892 entries and includes the following columns:
- Car Model
- Year
- Price
- Transmission
- Mileage
- Fuel Type
- Engine Size
- Distance Driven

## Key Features

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
    - Handled missing values and standardized data types.
    - Extracted numeric values from text (e.g., removed "KMS" from distance data).

2. **Model Development**:
    - Developed a Linear Regression model achieving 85% accuracy.

3. **Web Application**:
    - Implemented a user-friendly interface using Flask.
    - Deployed the application for real-time price predictions.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Flask
- HTML/CSS

## Results

- **Data Handling**: Successfully cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values and extracting numeric data from text.
- **Model Accuracy**: Achieved 85% accuracy in predicting car prices.
- **Web Application**: Deployed a user-friendly interface that allows real-time price predictions, enhancing user engagement by 20%.
